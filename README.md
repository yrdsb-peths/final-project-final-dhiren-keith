Shooty McShootface is a 2D space shooter game where you battle waves of enemies across five unlockable worlds. Use W/A/S/D to move and arrow keys to shoot, leveling up as you defeat waves. Press L to activate a cheat that boosts your level by 5; at level 20, a piercing shot unlocks. After every wave you automatically level up by five which also increases the enemies difficulty. Defeat all five worlds to achieve level 100 and successfully complete Shooty McShootFace.
